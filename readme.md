# Concatenate
Yeah, big word.
All it really means is combine text (remember, text is called a string) and variables together into single sentences! ðŸ˜²ðŸ¤¯

You can make your input and output look super pretty now! ðŸ¥³
```
myName = input("What's your name? ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")
```
It turns out print has a super-power. We can give it as many different things to print as we want. All we need to do is put a comma , between every different thing in the ().

# The Ultimate Wacky Recipe Maker

We have learned enough skills for a simple, but cool, project!

Remember when you were a kid and thought the ideal dinner would just be all your favorite things mixed in a bowl? How did that Nutella Mac & Cheese taste?  **Well - let's come up with a recipe generator to build us an amazing dish for today's evening meal!**

You will need to:

1.  Create these as a variable:
    -   A type of food
    -   A type of plant
    -   A method of cooking
    -   A word to describe burned food
    -   A household item

2. Output a nice looking Recipe page that *concatenates* a dish in this format:

-   `cooking`  `food`  with  `burned`  `plant`  on a bed of  `item`

## Example (No Peeking the Solution Yet):

Name a food > Mac & Cheese

Name a type of plant > Cactus

Name a method of cooking > Saute 

What word describes burned food? > Ruined

Name a DIY item > Hammer

MENU

Saute Mac & Cheese with Ruined Cactus on a bed of Hammers

EXTRA: Remix your recipe to include more variables and a wackier type of dish.

### Why not step it up and create a recipe for a starter, main course and dessert?
